`onfontready` relies on the relative widths of the font being detected and at least two other fonts.

## Basic Concept

When a browser sees a list of fonts in a `font-family` or `font` property, it will attempt to use the first one in the list. If that font isn't available because the font is still downloading, or completely unavailable, the browser will try the next font as a fallback. And so it will proceed down the list of fallback fonts until it encounters a generic font family or the end of the list. Though some [browsers use different techniques](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/font-display?hl=en) to control the visual display of fonts that it knows are still loading, `onfontready` can take advantage of the text geometry of fallback fonts to determine if the custom web font is ready.


## Two Font Stacks

Consider the following HTML.

```html
<style>
.text1 {
    font-family: 'MyCustomFont', serif;
}

.text2 {
    font-family: 'MyCustomFont', monospace;
}
</style>
<span class="text1">hello</span>
<span class="text2">hello</span>
```

If "MyCustomFont" is not available, or still being loaded or parsed, fallback fonts will be used. The first span tag will use the serif generic font and the second span tag will use the monospace generic font. Even though the browser may hide the text itself, the width of the text will be determined by the width of the word "hello" in each span's generic fallback font. Because serif and monospace have different widths for the word "hello", the two span tags will also have different widths.

Once "MyCustomFont" becomes available, however, both span tags will have exactly the same width. Their fonts and contents now match exactly. Barring other interfering styles, they should be pixel-for-pixel identical, save for their location on the page.

`onfontready` simply provides a means to detect the difference in widths, along with a means to detect if the browser recently swapped the fallback font for the newly loaded web font.


## Detecting Font Swaps

There is no direct means for the page's Javascript to query the browser for the status or availability of a font, [at least not yet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Font_Loading_API). One cannot know if a font is already loaded or parsed directly. While measuring text widths on fallback stacks can detect at any given time if a font is available or not, there is no event that the browser will fire when it swaps one font for another. A method to detect the changing width of a tag's text is needed. There are several ways to do that.

### 1. `setTimeout` Polling

Using a `setTimeout` delay, repeatedly check the widths of two or more font stacks looking for equality. This is highly inefficient. If the delay is too short, the browser will be bogged down with blocking requests for DOM measurements. If the delay is too long, the library will be late detecting the readiness of the web font.


### 2. Sized Container Scroll Events

The `resize` event only fires on the top-level context, which is the browser window object in most cases. However, the desire is to detect a resize on a specific element. Starting from an initially detected element size, a complex set of DOM elements can be set up to detect the resizing of a specific element. This is done by making two elements that have widths and heights calculated relative to their parent element. Using `position: absolute` and carefully controlling the overflow and scroll position, `scroll` events detect any size changes. If the parent element shrinks, one of the ruler elements will fire a `scroll` event. If the parent element expands, the other ruler element will fire a `scroll` event. The rulers must then be immediately reset relative to the new size, and the process begins again for the next resize occurrence. This technique works well. It is very efficient for font-loading purposes. However, Internet Explorer 9 and lower simply do not detect `scroll` events unless they are initiated directly by the user (see [tests](../tests/scrollBasedResizeDetectionTest/index.html)). Setting up the rulers are relatively complex and prone to error. This technique is used by [Font Face Observer](https://github.com/bramstein/fontfaceobserver/).


### 3. Sized iframe Resize Events

Because an iframe has its own window context, it can detect `resize` events on itself. By ensuring that an iframe's size is relative to the width of a tag's text, any change to the text size will cause the iframe to fire a `resize` event. This is not memory-efficient due to the cost of starting up and shutting down an iframe context, even for a blank page. However, the technique is very well supported, working even in Internet Explorer 6. Furthermore, the technique is much simpler to implement and compresses very well. This technique was pioneered by [Back Alley Coder](http://www.backalleycoder.com/2013/03/18/cross-browser-event-based-element-resize-detection/) and is used by both the standard and `legacy` versions of `onfontready`.


### 4. ResizeObserver (Future)

At the time of writing, Google is attempting to introduce the [ResizeObserver](https://wicg.github.io/ResizeObserver/), an API that would detect resizes of individual elements regardless of how those resizes occurred. With this API, the font-triggered element resize change could be detected directly on the element without using an iframe. This would be far more efficient than using iframes, and less confusing than the Sized Container Scroll Events method. Once ResizeObserver becomes available in browsers, it will not save very many bytes relative to the iframe method. However, its efficiency makes it a great method in every other respect. If ResizeObservers become officially supported by the HTML5 and Javascript authorities, `onfontready` will eventually transition to using ResizeObservers by default, and fall back to the iframe method if ResizeObservers are not supported. [Read more about ResizeObservers](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/resizeobserver).


## Space Character

Previous versions of `onfontready` had to rely on a special test string for detecting widths. The selection of the test string was very important for some fonts. If a font contained only a subset of characters, skipping most English letters for example, the default test string of "onfontready" would use fonts from the fallback font instead. This was undesirable, because if even one letter in the test string was not found in the web font, the test string would forever remain unequal in width, regardless of the font loading status. To account for this, `onfontready` versions prior to `1.1.0` mandated the specification of a `sampleText` option value for fonts that didn't support all the characters in the default string ("onfontready"). This technique also relied on the assumption that a given string will always have a different width in serif, sans-serif, and monospace generic fonts. While it is highly probable that the font widths will be different, it is not impossible for them to all share the same width for a carefully constructed test string.

More recently, as part of research for version `1.1.0` of `onfontready`, the common availability of the humble [space character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character) (ASCII #32) revealed its usefulness. With exactly [one known special-case exception](http://stackoverflow.com/q/39172165/195068), every font available or generated contains the space character, even icon fonts. Every browser appears to have vastly different space character widths for the serif and monospace generic font families (see [test data](../tests/spaceCharacterWidths/index.html)). With this knowledge, `onfontready` uses a single space as the test string by default. This removes the need to specify a test string in all common fonts. In addition to simplifying library usage, this improvement reduced the size and memory usage of `onfontready` greatly.
